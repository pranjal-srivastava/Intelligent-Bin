# Intelligent-Bin
waste segregation and reward system for the users of the dustbin by using the principle of image processing
It is A SMART BIN which sorts out three types of waste that are metal, plastic and paper/cardboard.
Image processing is the basic principle which works here. 
People also get rewarded when they dump the waste in the bin by linking this system to Aadhar Card. 
When the bin gets full, the concerned authorities are reminded to take action.
